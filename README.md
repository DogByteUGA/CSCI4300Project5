Project 5 Due: March 22 (Sunday) by Midnight
Right now, I have the server set up locally, which contains the myswl imdb_small databse
AS a root username, my password is flaker, as a guest it might work to have an empty
username and password, though I am not sure. I thought the directions were unclear about 
the mysql server. On my end, the Search all .php is almost completed. It just needs to put the found data into a table and add a column that add numbers(it also needs to decide unique ID's).
